#Things I learned: Salmon Cookies.
  After a lot of trial and error (including during last 201) I was able to successfully use the reduce method to bring the values in the array down to one number for the Totals.

#Things I learned: Busmall.
  While I didn't implement it in my final working version I was able to use splice correctly. The goal was to splice three of the images off an array to use on the HTML. I was trying to use fisher-yates shuffle to randomize (and not repeat), but it was pretty pointless because I still needed to use the normal logic I would have to check for images prior to being used.
